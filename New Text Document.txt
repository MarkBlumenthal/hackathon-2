I have a school project that i need to use
backend with Node.js and PostgreSQL using neon console, bcrypt, frontend with static files Bootstrap etc.
The project should solve the following topic:
Fitness and diet strategies.                 I want to create a parody of this called lets get fat, so instead of losing weight its a website for gaining weight. I want a landing page that expalains to the user that the website offers meal plans and daily exercises and a track progress to reach their desired weight. on the landing page I want a log in feature and a register feature. if they choose to log in or register, i want this done on the same page, i dont want them re directed to a new page to log in or register. they must enter name, username, email and password. I want the password hashed to be stored in a neon console table. (if they log in or register succsessfully display message welcome) (if the user already exsists display user already exsists) once they log in they are directed to their user page where they need to enter their height, age, and current weight, and their desired weight. then on the same page once they have entered those details i want to generate a question asking if they want an all carb diet or an all dessert diet. once they have chosen on the same page i want to generate 3 tables. one for meal plans, one for exercise plan and one for progress. keep in mind i basically want this done only with 2 html pages, one landing/loggin and one for their personal area. all the tables and data must be stored in neon console. i also want the progress table updated when the user enters what they have eaten that day and what exercise they did. exercises can include channel surfing, playing video games, 20 bites of fudge etc. and also include a logout button
