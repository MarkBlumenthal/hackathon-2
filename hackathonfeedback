**Project: Let's Get Fat - A Diet and Exercise Parody Website**

- The project demonstrates proficiency in developing a parody website aimed at humorously encouraging weight gain through a combination of diet plans and exercise suggestions.
- Notably, the website effectively utilizes Express.js for server-side routing and handling HTTP requests. Session management with Express Session enhances user experience by maintaining user authentication state.
- However, the code could benefit from further organization and separation of concerns, particularly by modularizing routes and controllers to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Express.js Routing**: 8/10
**Session Management**: 7/10
**Code Organization**: 6/10

**Overall: 7/10**
